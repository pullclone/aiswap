# aiswap
The intelligent profile switcher, aiswap is a utility that lets you instantly switch between different AI personalities and service configurations (like Claude, Gemini, Mistral, and OpenAI) without ever touching a config file manually. It is designed to be invisible when it works, and informative if something goes wrong.
